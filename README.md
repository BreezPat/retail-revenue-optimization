## Key Analyses Performed

### 1. Average Profit Margin by Sub-Category  
Analyzed which product lines contribute the highest profitability relative to their sales volume.

### 2. Discount vs Profitability by Category  
Explored how increased discounts impact total profit in each major product category.

### 3. Segment-Level Performance  
Visualized sales contribution by customer segment (e.g., Corporate, Home Office, Consumer).

### 4. Top & Bottom Products by State  
Mapped product sales extremes per state to identify where specific SKUs excel or fail.

### 5. Category Performance by City  
Focused on top-performing cities to understand which categories are strongest in which urban markets.
