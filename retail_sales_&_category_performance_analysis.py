# üõí Retail Revenue Optimization & Category Performance Analysis

This project explores key retail performance indicators using transactional data from multiple U.S. cities and states. The objective is to uncover actionable insights in sales, category profitability, discount strategies, and geographic patterns ‚Äî helping inventory and merchandising analysts make smarter decisions.

### Key Areas Explored:
- **Profitability Trends**: Analyzed average profit margins across sub-categories to identify high-margin and loss-leading product lines.
- **Discount Effectiveness**: Studied how varying discount levels affect profit across categories.
- **Customer Segments**: Assessed which segments (e.g., Corporate, Consumer, Home Office) drive the most revenue.
- **Geographic Intelligence**: Identified the best and worst-selling products by state and evaluated category-level sales across top-performing cities.

> This notebook is designed for business analysts, replenishment planners, and category managers looking to optimize sales strategies and improve profit margins.

"""**Some Insights**:
This visualization highlights the average profit margin across different product sub-categories. Key insights include:

- High-margin sub-categories like Labels (42.97%), Paper (42.56%), and Envelopes (42.31%) generate the most profit per sale. These should be prioritized in pricing and promotional strategies.

- Low to negative margin categories such as Binders (-19.96%), Appliances (-15.69%), and Tables (-14.77%) signal possible over-discounting, supply chain issues, or pricing misalignment.

- These trends help identify which product lines may be draining profits and which ones offer the best return on investment for marketing, replenishment, and shelf space.

### üìâ Discount vs. Profit Analysis

This chart explores the relationship between discount rates and profit margins across product categories. Each point represents a transaction, with colors indicating different categories.

- A red dashed line at y = 0 separates profitable and loss-making orders.
- Helps assess whether discounts are strategically driving volume or eroding profit margins.

"""Interpretation: High discount rates (above 40%) are often associated with negative profits, especially in the Office Supplies and Technology categories.

- Most loss-making orders appear clustered near 0.5 to 0.8 discount range.
- Furniture items show relatively moderate profit loss compared to other categories.
- The red line at y=0 highlights how excessive discounting can push transactions into the loss zone.

Insight: Strategic discounting is necessary‚Äîdeep discounts can erode profitability unless compensated by volume or vendor subsidies.

The Consumer segment accounts for the largest portion of total sales ($1.16M), followed by Corporate ($706K), and Home Office (~$430K).

- For example:

   - In Florida, the Cisco TelePresence System EX90 was a major success, while Avery Binder Labels struggled significantly.

   - In California, the High Speed Electric Letter Opener outperformed others, while Colored Push Pins underwhelmed.

   - Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier appeared multiple times as a top seller, suggesting it's a reliably high-performing SKU across regions.

- Los Angeles also performs strongly across all categories, especially in Technology and Furniture.

- Seattle and San Francisco show balanced sales distribution, making them promising markets for all categories.

- Cities like Jacksonville, San Diego, and Springfield have lower overall sales, suggesting potential opportunities for local growth strategies.

# üìä Executive Summary

This analysis reveals meaningful patterns in product performance, profit contribution, and customer behavior across regions:

- üîπ **Profit Margin Trends**: Products in the *Labels*, *Paper*, and *Envelopes* sub-categories deliver over **40% average margins**, while *Binders* and *Appliances* result in losses ‚Äî key focus areas for margin optimization.

- üîπ **Discount vs. Profit**: High discount levels (30%+) often lead to negative profit, especially in *Technology* and *Furniture*. A targeted discounting strategy is needed to protect margins.

- üîπ **Customer Segment Insights**: The *Consumer* segment contributes over **$1.1M** in sales ‚Äî more than double that of *Home Office* ‚Äî confirming it as the top revenue-generating segment.

- üîπ **Product Winners and Losers by State**: Items like *Canon imageCLASS Copiers* and *Cisco TelePresence Systems* are state-level top performers, while low-cost office supplies like *Labels* and *Push Pins* frequently underperform.

- üîπ **City-Level Category Performance**: *New York City*, *Los Angeles*, and *Seattle* lead in total sales across all categories, with *Technology* consistently dominating ‚Äî supporting regional category prioritization.

> ‚úÖ **Business Takeaway:** To improve revenue and margin, focus on high-performing products in top cities and customer segments. Avoid blanket discounts, and evaluate underperforming SKUs for potential phase-out or re-pricing.
